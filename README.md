# mqtt-bridges
Various bridges between MQTT and different hardware written in python for use with OpenHab.

Used hardware:

Satel Integra 128WRL (http://www.satel.pl/)

EAP(Meter http://www.pozyton.com.pl/polskiepdf/eap.pdf),

OpenTherm Gateway, Viessmann Vitovent-300 (http://otgw.tclcode.com/)

GPRS Modem Huawei E3372

DS18B20 1-Wire Digital Thermometer (owfs.org)

OptoLink Viessmann Vitocal 222-G (https://openv.wikispaces.com/)


This is a backup of my setup. Works for me, maybe it will work for you. I'm not a Python programmer ;)
